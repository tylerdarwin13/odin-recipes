    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This Chorizo Spinach scramble is one of my favorite breakfast meals. Cheesy scrambled eggs are perfectly
        complimented by
        the smokey spice flavor of chorizo, and spinach helps prevent the dish from tasting too fatty. All of the
        ingredients
        are naturally gluten-free, too!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>3 Large Eggs</strong></li>
        <li><strong>6 oz. Chorizo</strong> - Any chorizo will work, but try to pick a firmer brand for the best flavor!
        </li>
        <li><strong>1/2 Cup Sharp Cheddar Cheese</strong> - Mexican cheese blends also work great.</li>
        <li><strong>1 Cup Fresh Spinach</strong> - Avoid frozen spinach for this dish, as it will give the eggs a watery
            texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Preferred Cooking Oil</strong> - Use butter if possible.</li>
        <li><strong>Seasoning</strong> - Most chorizo has enough spice to carry the dish already, but I enjoy finishing
            with salt and pepper!</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat your pan over medium high heat. While your pan is heating, chop the spinach
            into thin strips, and beat eggs.</li>
        <li>Coat your pan in a light layer of oil, and add the chorizo. Break it into an even
            layer with your spatula, and turn regularly until it is fully cooked.</li>
        <li>Add egg mixture to pan, and cover with spinach and cheese.</li>
        <li>Turn dish often to cook evenly. Top with salt and pepper and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

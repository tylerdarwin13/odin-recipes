    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Chicken Quesadillas are an easy and satisfying meal, requiring little adjustment for us gluten-free eaters. This
        simple recipe is one of my favorites, and might soon be yours too.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Corn Tortillas</strong> - The easiest and best option for gluten-free tortillas.</li>
        <li><strong>Cooked Chicken</strong> - Rotisserie chicken is my favorite for this recipe, making it even easier
            than it already is!</li>
        <li><strong>Mexican Cheese Blend</strong> - Sharp cheddar is another great choice. Basically any shredded cheese
            will work, and it's worth it to experiment!</li>
        <li><strong>Preferred Cooking Oil</strong> - Any standard cooking oil works, but I reccommend butter!</li>
        <li><strong>Seasoning</strong> - Salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Other seasonings are optional.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat pan to medium heat and add cooking oil. Add the bottom tortilla to pan. <em>Note - you can make multiple quesadillas in a single pan if its big enough. Just make sure they don't overlap!</em></li>
        <li>Add a thin layer of cheese on top of the tortillas.</li>
        <li>Top the cheese with chicken. Season the half-made quesadilla with salt,
            pepper, and garlic powder.</li>
        <li>Top with a heavy serving of cheese, followed by the other tortilla.</li>
        <li>When the bottom layer of cheese is melted, flip the quesadilla. Turn as needed until the tortillas and cheese are warm and crispy on both sides.</li>
        <li>Cut into quarters, plate, and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

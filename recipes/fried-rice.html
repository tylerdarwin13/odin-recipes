    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Fried rice is one of my favorite recipes. Not only because it's delicious, but because it's easy to
        make, too! This recipe uses a simple range of ingredients, but is very flexible. If there's an ingredient you
        enjoy in your fried rice that we left out, feel free to add it!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>1.5 Cup Cold, Cooked Rice</strong> - Any standard rice will work, but it must be cooked and cooled
            <em>before</em> preparation. I recommend cooking it the night before and leaving it in the fridge.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Bag of Frozen Veggie Mix</strong> - Frozen veggies are significantly more efficient for quick
            recipes such
            as this. My version calls for a pea and carrot mix, but feel free to customize!</li>
        <li><strong>Seasoning</strong> - Salt, pepper, and garlic powder.</Li>
        <li><strong>Sesame Seeds</strong> - If you want to be extra fancy you can use furikake as well, but normal
            sesame should be just fine.</li>
        <li><strong>Preferred Cooking Oil</strong> - Butter and sesame oil work best, but nearly any will do!</li>
        <li><strong>1 Cup Cooked Chicken</strong> - For extra ease, a rotisserie chicken works great!</li>
        <li><strong>2 Eggs</strong> - Add more or less to taste.</li>
        <li><strong>Gluten-Free Soy Sauce</strong> - Alternatively <strong>coconut aminos</strong>, for a sweeter
            flavor.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat your pan over medium high heat.</li>
        <li>Coat bottom of pan with oil.</li>
        <li>Add veggie mix and cook until defrosted. Portion will depend on the size of
            your pan, but make sure you have enough room to stir after everything else is added.</li>
        <li>Push the veggies to the side of the pan. Add another touch of oil to the empty
            spot in the center, and crack your eggs. Scramble them, then mix them in with the veggies.</li>
        <li>Add the rice and chicken. Remember that the rice needs to be cold when we add
            it. If we put it in the pan hot, it will get mushy and won't fry properly.</li>
        <li>Stir the entire mixture together, incrementally adding the seasoning. Once it is
            seasoned, let the dish sit for a while to fry. Stirring too frequently disrupts the frying process, so be
            patient!</li>
        <li>As the rice starts to approach the level of crunchiness you enjoy, finish it
            off with the soy sauce, green onions, and sesame. Give it a few more stirs to mix it all together, and the meal is done.</li>
        <li>Add more soy sauce to tast and <em>enjoy!</em></li>
    </ol>
